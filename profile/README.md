## Project Description

### What is Deku?

Deku aims to provide an `seamless cross-chain transaction experience` that offers users `batch multiple cross-chain transactions into one request`. By creating a membership payment system that utilizes blockchain technology --using Account Abstraction for customization, users can potentially receive discounts on gas fees and even pay gas with native tokens -- can be anything! Additionally, the ability to customize benefits based on membership tier could provide a `personalized experience for users while also allowing communities to set specific conditions for each tier`.

### Usecase

For example, lets say Gitcoin is running their own rollup. And using Deku, other rollups that uses same DA layer as Gitcoin can actually do `cross-chain public goods voting` and batch this `multiple voting transactions into one DA request`.
